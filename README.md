# ITIN4500-Module7
This week Module was about learning database options, and I learned about MySQL, CloudKit, Firebase, Core Dta, Realm.
The leacture was not about how to use them, but more abut what they are.
From next week module I'll work with Firebase and Realm and actualy making apps by using them.
